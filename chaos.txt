“I didn't fall in love with you.
I walked into love with you, 
with my eyes wide open,
choosing to take every step along the way. 
I do believe in fate and destiny, 
but I also believe we are only fated to do the things that we'd choose anyway. 
And I'd choose you; in a hundred lifetimes, 
in a hundred worlds, in any version of reality,
I'd find you and I'd choose you” 
? Kiersten White, The Chaos of Stars
