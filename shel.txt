If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band,

We’d travel all over the land.

We’d play and we’d sing and wear spangly things,

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band.

 

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band,

And we were up there on the stand,

The people would hear us and love us and cheer us,

Hurray for that rock ‘n’ roll band.

 

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band,

Then we’d have a million fans.

We’d goggle and laugh and sign autographs,

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band.

 

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band,

The people would all kiss our hands.

We’d be millionaires and have extra long hair,

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band.

 

But we ain’t no rock ‘n’ roll band,

We’re just seven kids in the sand

With homemade guitars and pails and jars

And drums of potato chip cans.

 

Just seven kids in the sand,

Talkin’ and wavin’ our hands,

And dreamin’ and thinkin’ oh wouldn’t it be grand,

If we were a rock ‘n’ roll band.
